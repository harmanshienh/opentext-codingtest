**Task 2:**
  - You are tasked to migrate a list of product information from one of the legacy platforms to a new platform. This is the page containing the product information: https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products?trial=true.

      - Product Name
      - Starting Letter, ex. "Adoption Readiness Tool" Ã  "A"
      - Description
      - Free Trial / Demo Request URL
      - Support Link URL
